#Making windows look awesome for development
##Goal
-------
Get a Terminal with [Solarized Colorpallet](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) and make gVim solarized.

------
Install [github for windows](https://windows.github.com).
That installation brings some unix tools with it that will make you fell right at home.

Follow this [Console 2 installation tutorial](http://www.railsbridgeboston.org/installfest/install/windows_console2) to get a great looking Terminal for your bash/powershell/cmd.exe.

Now we need to [wrap our github bash in console 2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23397236/how-to-wrap-the-bash-shell-from-github-for-windows-in-console2) ( check out answer number 1 )

To make things even more awesome we will now [solarize console 2 ](http://www.curlybrace.com/words/2012/02/12/console2-and-cygwin-with-solarized-color-palette/)

If you have followed along you should now have a rly nice looking terminal that you can use for coding on windows.
Happy Coding.
